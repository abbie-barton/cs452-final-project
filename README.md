# Animal Shelter Website
This project focuses on creating a user friendly animal shelter website for a local animal shelter. Oftentimes animal shelter websites aren't very user friendly, or easy for the administrators to use because of limited funding. This project aims to create a new website for a local shelter using new technology to replace their old website - an improved design will help improve visibility and potentially increase the rate at which animals are adopted, increasing the services that the animal shelter can provide for the community.
# Technologies
This project uses React / Typescript for the frontend, and Python / AWS / MySQL for the backend. There is also an option to integrate the backend as a CMS instead.
# Components
The user-facing component is the website, which contains listings for all the animals currently housed at the shelter. Users can adopt, foster, or surrender animals. There will also be an admin portal to handle adding and removing animals from the website, or updating their descriptions, whether created in React or hosted on a CMS.
